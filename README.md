# Popular Movies App

## Project Overview
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, I have built an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. I have split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1.

## My app will:

Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
original title
movie poster image thumbnail
A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
user rating (called vote_average in the api)
release date

## What did I Learn?
Through this project:

Creating a gridview with custom adaptor

Parcelables and onSaveInstanceState()

Using Picasso library

Using Lint to check errors and warning in the project

Practice consuming data from RESTful API and JSON parsing to a model object

Making sure my app does not crash when there is no network connection! 

Design activity layouts

Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
